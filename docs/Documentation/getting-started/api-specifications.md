In the [API Reference] ([https://beta.realestateapi.com/reference/property-search-api](https://beta.realestateapi.com/reference/property-search-api)), you will be introduced to a variety of different product offerings that will help you build applications, your own APIs, or datasets. The required search fields and allowable search parameters are outlined in full, but if you ever have trouble you can join our Discord Community or email us directly to get help ([dev@realestateapi.com](mailto:dev@realestateapi.com)).

In the Recipes section, you will find helpful code snippets and functions that will get you started with ready-made solutions to common uses of the API and the different endpoints we offer.
