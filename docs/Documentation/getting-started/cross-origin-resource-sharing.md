This API does **not** allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).  All calls should be server to server.  RealEstateAPI prohibits browser based call due to public access to your keys and likelihood of a bad actor gaining access to your keys. RealEstateAPI is not responsible for the misuse of your API key, and you will be responsible for all charges associated with its use.

**Note**: For API key management best practice, we recommend regenerating new API keys every 90 days to make sure inactive or old keys have a lower chance of being compromised. To get an API key, schedule a meeting with us here: [https://calendly.com/realestate-api/discovery](https://calendly.com/realestate-api/discovery)
