## üîê Authentication

All API requests require an API key to be included in the request headers.

### Required Header
```
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

### Getting an API Key
Contact your API provider to obtain a valid API key. Each key is unique and should be kept secure.

### Authentication Example
```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key-here" \
  "https://api.realestateapi.com/v2/PropertySearch/odata?$top=10"
```

---

## üåê Base URL & Endpoints

### Base URL
```
https://api.realestateapi.com/v2
```

### Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/PropertySearch/odata` | GET | Main property search with OData query support |
| `/health` | GET | API health check (no authentication required) |

---

## üìù Request Format

### HTTP Method
All requests use the `GET` method.

### Required Headers
```
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
Content-Type: application/json
```

### URL Structure
```
GET /PropertySearch/odata?[odata-parameters]
```

---

## üìä Response Format

All successful responses follow the OData v4 JSON format:

```json
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#PropertySearch",
  "@odata.count": 1234,
  "value": [
    {
      "id": 12345,

```

### Response Fields Description

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `@odata.context` | string | OData metadata context |
| `@odata.count` | number | Total number of matching properties |
| `value` | array | Array of property objects |

---

## üîç Query Parameters

The API supports standard OData query parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `$filter` | Filter results | `$filter=city eq 'Austin'` |
| `$top` | Limit results (max 1000) | `$top=10` |
| `$skip` | Skip results for pagination | `$skip=20` |
| `$orderby` | Sort results | `$orderby=estimatedValue desc` |
| `$count` | Include total count | `$count=true` |


### $filter
Filter properties based on field values.

**Syntax:** `$filter=field operator value`

**Supported Operators:**
- `eq` - equals
- `ne` - not equals  
- `gt` - greater than
- `gte` - greater than or equal
- `lt` - less than
- `lte` - less than or equal
- `and` - logical AND
- `or` - logical OR
- `not` - logical NOT

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `eq` | Equals | `city eq 'Austin'` |
| `ne` | Not equals | `vacant ne true` |
| `gt` | Greater than | `estimatedValue gt 500000` |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal | `bedrooms gte 3` |
| `lt` | Less than | `yearBuilt lt 2000` |
| `lte` | Less than or equal | `bathrooms lte 2` |
| `and` | Logical AND | `bedrooms eq 3 and bathrooms gt 2` |
| `or` | Logical OR | `vacant eq true or absenteeOwner eq true` |
| `not` | Logical NOT | `not (mlsActive eq true)` |


**Field-to-Field Comparisons:**
The API supports comparing two fields directly, including both top-level and nested field comparisons.

**Supported Patterns:**
- Top-level fields: `estimatedValue gt mlsListingPrice`
- Nested fields: `propertyInfo.bedrooms gt propertyInfo.bathrooms`
- Mixed levels: `estimatedValue gt taxInfo.assessedValue`

**Performance Note:** Field-to-field comparisons use null-checking for robustness. These are slightly slower than term/range queries, so consider pagination for large datasets.

**Examples:**
```
$filter=estimatedValue gt 500000
$filter=absenteeOwner eq true
$filter=estimatedValue gt mlsListingPrice
$filter=estimatedEquity gt openMortgageBalance
$filter=propertyInfo.bedrooms gt propertyInfo.bathrooms
$filter=taxInfo.assessedValue eq taxInfo.marketValue
$filter=estimatedValue gt 300000 and estimatedValue gt mlsListingPrice
```

### $top
Limit the number of results returned (max: 1000).

**Syntax:** `$top=number`

**Example:**
```
$top=25
```

### $skip
Skip a number of results for pagination.

**Syntax:** `$skip=number`

**Example:**
```
$skip=50
```

### $orderby
Sort results by one or more fields.

**Syntax:** `$orderby=field [asc|desc]`

**Examples:**
```
$orderby=estimatedValue desc
$orderby=propertyInfo.yearBuilt asc,estimatedValue desc
```

### $count
Include total count in response.

**Syntax:** `$count=true`

**Example:**
```
$count=true
```

## üöÄ Rate Limits & Best Practices

### Rate Limits
- **Requests per minute:** 100
- **Requests per hour:** 2,000
- **Daily limit:** 10,000

### Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Filters**
   - Always include meaningful filters to reduce response size
   - Avoid overly broad queries without filters

2. **Implement Pagination**
   - Use `$top` and `$skip` for large result sets
   - Recommended page size: 25-100 records

3. **Cache Results**
   - Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls
   - Property data typically updates daily

4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
   - Implement retry logic for 5xx errors
   - Validate field names before making requests

5. **Optimize Queries**
   - Use `$count=true` only when needed
   - Sort results on indexed fields when possible

6. **Secure API Keys**
   - Never expose API keys in client-side code
   - Use environment variables for API key storage
   - Rotate API keys regularly

## üíª SDKs & Code Examples

### JavaScript/Node.js
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

class RealEstateAPI {
  constructor(apiKey, baseUrl = 'https://api.realestateapi.com/v2') {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
  }

  async searchProperties(filters = {}) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    
    if (filters.filter) params.append('$filter', filters.filter);
    if (filters.top) params.append('$top', filters.top);
    if (filters.skip) params.append('$skip', filters.skip);
    if (filters.orderby) params.append('$orderby', filters.orderby);
    if (filters.count) params.append('$count', 'true');

    try {
      const response = await axios.get(`${this.baseUrl}/PropertySearch/odata`, {
        headers: {
          'x-api-key': this.apiKey,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        params: Object.fromEntries(params)

        throw new Error(`API Error: ${error.response.data.message}`);
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

// Usage Example
const api = new RealEstateAPI('your-api-key-here');

// Search for high-value properties in Austin
api.searchProperties({
  filter: "propertyInfo.address.city eq 'Austin' and estimatedValue gt 750000",
  top: 25,
  orderby: 'estimatedValue desc',
  count: true
}).then(result => {
  console.log(`Found ${result['@odata.count']} properties`);
  console.log('Properties:', result.value);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error.message);
});
```
