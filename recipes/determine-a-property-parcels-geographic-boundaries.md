    //}
    
    //let input3 = {
    //  id: '<Any "id" value from Property Search API response objects>'
    //}
    
    await findPropertyBoundary(input);

# Step 1: Prepare the API Input



There are 3 different ways to call the Property Boundary API: full formatted address, address parts, and property ID.

If you are mapping Property Search API results onto a Google Map or similar interface in an app, then you should use the property "id" field to get their respective latitude/longitude polygon boundaries.

# Step 2: Grab the Important Response Properties



The two most notable fields on this response are latitude, longitude, location, and geometry.

Latitude & Longitude are of type "double" (commonly known as decimals) with 5 digits are precision.

Location represents a GeoPoint object in the format: POINT(-74.875428 40.007765)

The Geometry property represents a GeoPolygon object. This value should be the most helpful in highlighting a specific region with defined boundaries on a map UI inside an application. The format for the polygon is: POLYGON((-74.8752287002844 40.0078993719293, -74.8753018687224 40.0079162935166, -74.8754901445418 40.0079687891152, -74.8756425603638 40.0076462306847, -74.8753422135154 40.0075623549745, -74.8752287002844 40.0078993719293))

After you are able to retrieve boundaries for your properties from this endpoint, the next step for application developers is to learn how to Drop Pins on a map for these properties or how to Draw Polygons on a map for the boundaries of a property or county.
