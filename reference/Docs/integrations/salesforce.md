# Salesforce + RealEstateAPI = Leads with a Purpose

## What is Salesforce?

Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses of all sizes manage their customer interactions and data. It provides a wide range of tools and services for sales, customer service, marketing, and collaboration, as well as a platform for building custom apps.

For application developers, Salesforce offers a powerful set of APIs and tools for building and integrating custom apps with the Salesforce platform. The Lightning Platform, which is part of Salesforce, provides a collection of tools and services for building and running customer-facing apps, including Lightning Components, Lightning Web Components, and Lightning App Builder. If you are looking to get started:

For business owners, Salesforce provides a central hub for managing customer interactions and data, as well as a range of tools and services for improving customer engagement and driving business growth. With Salesforce, you can manage customer interactions across multiple channels, track and analyze customer data, and automate business processes.

Salesforce is a powerful and flexible platform that can help businesses of all sizes improve their customer relationships and drive business growth, and with our powerful data warehouse we can even take it a step further.

## Integrating with RealEstateAPI

Has your sales team ever been confused where to start once they get on a call? Or even while planning out who the highest value prospects are? 

Have your prospects ever asked for more info on the leads in your Salesforce apps? Struggle to find good APIs or microservices to connect your application too, that are also fast and cost effective?

This is where RealEstateAPI (REAPI) comes in. We've designed our powerful REST (simple HTTPS) endpoints to serve your applications or pipelines with the best and most up to date data possible and in ways that don't slow down your UI and can help you provide useful functionality to your users.

Whether you are using pure Javascript & HTML, Apex, SPAs, or any other technical stack inside of Salesforce, there is an easy way to incorporate API calls to RealEstateAPI in any Salesforce architecture you have set up and instantly start enriching your CRM contacts.

# Salesforce Dev Tools

## Salesforce CLI ("sfdx")

When building Salesforce apps in your desired IDE, you'll want to make use of Salesforce's official CLI library that will help you develop, test, and deploy from the command line.

# Lightning Web Components

Lightning Components are a set of UI elements that you can use to build Lightning Experiences and stand-alone apps. They are built using HTML and JavaScript, and they can be used to create custom interfaces for Salesforce or to integrate with external services. Lightning Components are part of the Lightning Platform, which is a collection of tools and services for building and running customer-facing apps on the Salesforce platform.

Here are some helpful references to start with Lighting Web Components in Salesforce:
