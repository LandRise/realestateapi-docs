Our services are meant to be easily implemented anywhere. Just follow our API reference and make calls to our endpoints using Bubble's external API connector.

You'll just have to meet with our team for a Discovery Call and get your API key to place in the "header" of these API calls in order for them to be authenticated.

Here's more info from Bubble on how their API Connectors work: [https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector](https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/api/the-api-connector)

To get RealEstateAPI data, copy the following example, and replace "&lt;Your-API-Key&gt;" with your REAPI key.

If you have made a successful call to one of our API endpoints, you will see a screen that looks like the following that allows you to pick the fields you'd like to keep.

NOTE: Make extra sure that your JSON body has **double** quotes around the field names and values.
