## PropGPT: The Next Generation of Property Searching

Imagine a future where you can find the perfect property by simply asking for it. Through the utilization of GPT, LLMs, Deep Learning, and AI, PropGPT transforms the real estate industry into a user-friendly experience that adapts to your needs. It's not just a search engine; it's your intelligent property-finding ally.

## How do I try it?

Just go over to the Beta version of our app at [https://www.propgpt.com/](https://www.propgpt.com/) and start getting ~~creative~~

Results will be provided in JSON data format, but we are looking to add more UI around the data returned and CSV data generation as well here soon.

## Not a Developer? Not a Problem.

Our innovative search engine interprets natural language queries to provide nuanced, accurate results against our Property Search API and Nationwide Property Data, cutting out the time-consuming task of sifting through countless field definitions just to craft the right JSON query to hit the API and get the data you want.

Even if you are not a developer, you will have immense search capabilities across our national dataset within seconds.

## What questions can I ask it?

For a reference of most of the ways you can search across our data, you can look at the search fields on our Property Search API as the foundation: [https://developer.realestateapi.com/reference/property-search-api](https://developer.realestateapi.com/reference/property-search-api)

### Simple Examples

"Find me properties in Arlington, VA that have between 3-5 beds and 4-6 baths"

"How many properties are listed in Arlington, VA below $1,000,000 on the MLS"

"Show me all active MLS listings in Richmond, VA"

. . . . . and the list goes on! And we are adding additional capabilities weekly!
