The "summary" flag can be used if instead of a list of properties or a count based on specific characteristics, you would rather search high level statistics of an area that will show you how many vacant, absentee, and other popular property types are in that geo.

```
let request = {
   "summary": true,
   "zip": "08046"
}
```
