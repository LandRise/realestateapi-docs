excerpt: >-
  Searchable API for list building, search counts, and advanced filtering on
  properties.  You can also use this API to implement your own comparables API,
  or property analytics API.  Questions?  Contact our team to ask us for best
  practices with using this API.This API implements easy paging so your apps can
  easily manage filtered results in a results pane with paging.  When your user
  clicks on a result, just use the id from this API to get the full property
  results using the Property Detail API.  Questions on best practices for
