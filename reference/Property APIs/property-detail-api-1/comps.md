Currently our Property Detail Endpoint is using /v2/PropertyComps when specifying "comps:true" in the request object.

* this will incur no extra credit charge

<br />

In order to access our low, medium, and high AVM range & customizable params, you will need to hit the /v3/PropertyComps endpoint directly: [https://developer.realestateapi.com/reference/v3-comps-response-object](https://developer.realestateapi.com/reference/v3-comps-response-object)

* hitting this endpoint directly will incur an extra charge of 1 credit per subject address (not per comp)
