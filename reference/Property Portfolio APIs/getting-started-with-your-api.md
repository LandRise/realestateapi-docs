Keeping your data updated in the frequently changing real estate landscape is a classic problem for anyone in industry. At RealEstateAPI, we know it's not just getting the data that matters, but getting the most up to date data to help equip your business or users with the most actionable and reliable insights into a given property.

<br />

The Property Portfolio APIs will help your team track a list of IDs or specific Property Searches to get new additions, updates on existing results, and deletions when the property no longer matches the search criteria being tracked.

<br />

Common use cases include tracking on-market vs. off-market status (mls\_active), (pre-)foreclosures / auctions being recorded / released, routine vacancy status checks in a zip-code, etc.
