RealEstateAPI supports a variety of real estate contexts for our AutoComplete. Choose the ones your users will have visibility to and make your initial app searches cater to the crowd you are trying to serve.

Use the "search\_types" field to define how your AutoComplete search box behaves on your website.

<br />

You can support multiple search\_types in one search bar, or separate them out.
