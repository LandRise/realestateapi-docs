Due to the rapidly changing landscape of Real Estate and the on-market inventory, one of the toughest challenges for people working with MLS Data is keeping up with updates. Every Day.

We make this easy and allow your team to specifically call for the updates you care about:

* New Listings => daily job speed: **10-15 seconds**
* Newly Sold Listings => daily job speed: **1-2 seconds**
* All Updated Listings => daily job speed: **1-2 mins**
* Listing Price Changes (price drops / price hikes) => daily job speed: **\<1 second**
* Listing Status Changes (e.g. "active" to "pending")
